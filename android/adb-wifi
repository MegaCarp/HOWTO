# obviously the devices need to be on the same wifi
# connect android device to pc 
# first time between devices - diddle around until "usb debugging" dialog happens - accept it "forever" 
# check the device appeared for pc:

adb devices

# then engage it in wifi mode using the script

chmod +x android/wifi-connect.sh
./android/wifi-connect.sh
