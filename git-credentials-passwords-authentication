# git will demand you do a jig before pushing anything:

# you have to run two commands that it will show you and a few that it won't
# run the two commands to identify yourself to the service, I don't think the answers matter...
# this is the part that's important now
# it demands a personal access token (PAT)
# create one here:
# https://github.com/settings/tokens

# the token will disappear forever after you close the page.. this is why you need to pass this line:

git config --global credential.helper cache

# this will save the auth data permanently
# since github thinks you're too smart for instructions, i'll spell it out:
# the password is the token string.

# you can now push in peace
