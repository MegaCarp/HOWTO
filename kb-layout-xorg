localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap us,ru pc104 grp:caps_toggle
# have to restart x
systemctl restart lightdm

# rooted
# kb has 104 buttons, us - default, ru - secondary, switch - caps
# i think you first need proper locales for that: "dpkg-reconfigure locales" as root
# editing .conf manually is a bad idea - localectl will eat that shit right up


# to find possible options for switch pass:
$ grep "grp:.*toggle" /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
