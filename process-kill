# narrow it down with 

ps aux | grep keepass

# for example, the above would also find the script that is mounting with rclone the keepass folder from gdrive. i'm unsure if killing "keepass"  would kill rclone also but it seems possible

ps aux | grep keepassxc

# this looks fine, usually I follow up with

killall -9 keepassxc

# if I actually want to be selective then it's

kill -9 [PID_HERE]
