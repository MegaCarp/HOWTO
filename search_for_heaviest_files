### find /home -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n | tail -n 5 ## obsolete
#TODO - salvage

# This will find all files in the folder $DIRECTORY which undergo ls -s. The result is then sorted numerically via the sort command and finally, the last five entries are displayed.
# To summarize, the command above will then display the largest 5 files in the folder /home

# you need root to go through home or /

# things you have no right to observe won't go into the pipeline 

# -xdev would keep the search to a single filesystem

# | grep -v would add exclusions, i use them successively: | grep -v foo | grep -v also_foo

# | sort -n | tail -n 5 should be at the end


find / -type f -size +100M -print -exec ls -lh {} \; | sort -k5,5 -h -r | head

# this one works better but possibly first could be salvaged for some parts?..
